REST API:
To get the list of lists:
http://icanmakemyownapp.com/iqbal/updated_scripts/get-list-of-lists.php

Along with book names, the call above will give you all the ListIDs.
To get the contents of a particular list of book, use that ListId to get data from this link:
http://icanmakemyownapp.com/iqbal/updated_scripts/get-list.php?listId={listID for this list}

The response of the get-list call contains the names and IDs of each poem in that book.
To get the contents of a specific poem, use the PoemID to get poem data from this link:
http://icanmakemyownapp.com/iqbal/updated_scripts/get-poem.php?poemId={poemID for the selected poem}

Note: I have not ported all the poems to the API based model yet.
Currently, there is only 1 poem uploaded. poemId = 2_1
Please use this for testing:
http://icanmakemyownapp.com/iqbal/updated_scripts/get-poem.php?poemId=2_1

Note: All responses are in valid YAML format
